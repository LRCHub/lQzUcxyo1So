Ever since you went away it feels like season's ending
And ain't it just like you to bloom and be gone
But spring can't last all year and the flowers will soon be fading
Lay your worries down for tomorrow may never come

So take a walk outside, tell your mama and them you love em
Cause once upon a time, they were just like me and you
Just a tiny little hand reaching for someone to love on
We come in this world a cryin' and we leave it all the same

Season's Ending
Winds are gonna change
Season's Ending
Only time will heal the pain
I've heard it said that God don't make no mistakes
But it's hard to say that God don't wear a crooked smile
I suppose the one that gives is the one that takes away
Seems like you can't have Heaven on earth without hell to pay

Season's Ending
Winds are gonna change
Season's Ending
Only time will heal the pain
